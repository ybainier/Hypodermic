 hypodermic (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * IRegistrationBuilder: asSelf() method introduced to let a component be resolved
by its default implementation type
  * ContainerBuilder no longer leaks its default IRegistrationBuilder implementation
through the other objects
  * GlobalFixture added to unit tests to tweak Boost.Test results reporter
  * ContainerBuilder.h does not need IRegistrationBuilder and RegistrationBuilder to
be forward declared
  * Some minor syntax issue fixed
  * build fix: sometimes, std::make_shared does not accept enough arguments so it's
been turned into std::shared_ptr
  * interfaces' virtual destructors are now pure virtual
  * Windows: _DEBUG and NDEBUG were not defined
  * libsel.h added for the sake of auto-linking (thanks to n.fauvet)
